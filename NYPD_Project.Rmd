## Step-1 Identify and import the data

I will start by reading in the data from the main csv files.

```{r}
url_NYPD <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

NYPD <- read.csv(url_NYPD)
```

##  Step-2 Cleaning the data
Now, I will cleaning gthe data and visualize to see 
```{r}
NYPD_clean <- NYPD %>%
  select(c("OCCUR_DATE","OCCUR_TIME","BORO","PRECINCT",
           "STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG","VIC_AGE_GROUP","VIC_SEX","VIC_RACE")) %>%
  mutate(OCCUR_DATE = mdy(OCCUR_DATE),
         OCCUR_TIME = hms(OCCUR_TIME),
         STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG = as.logical(STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG),
         Shootings = 1,
         Year = year(OCCUR_DATE))


NYPD_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = BORO, fill = BORO)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "NYPD Shootings Incidents by Borough",
       subtitle = "(2006 - 2021)",
       x = "NYC Boroughs",
       y = "Total Number of Shootings",
       caption = "(Figure - 1)")

NYPD_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue",show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "NYPD Shootings Incidents by Year",
       x = "Years (2006 - 2021)",
       y = "Total Number of Shootings",
       caption = "(Figure - 2)")
```
##  Step-3 Analyze and Visulize data
```{r}
NYPD_year <- NYPD_clean %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%

## Step-4 Choose model
```{r}
